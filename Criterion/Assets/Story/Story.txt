Null was living in his village in peace with his familiars.
Until an unkown group has come to the village.
When they came, some problems began to happen.
Some of them lost their equipments.
Some vehicles broke.
And the whole village had to stop it's work.
But nobody could solve the problems.
Null was angry and suspicious.
Null started to invastigate the problems.
He must be quick.
